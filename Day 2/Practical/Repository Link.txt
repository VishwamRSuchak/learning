Day 2:
1. Creating New Repository & Made 2 html files in my repository.
2. cloning it in my local system.
3. Performing Changes in both files locally then staged 1 file & Commited that html file, then pushed that html file.
4. Performed Changes in 1 file remotely then performed changes in that same file locally.
5. Then stashed the local file.
6. Then pulling the remote file and both files conflicted (remote & local).
7. Then applied stash & accepted incoming changes in the local file and solved conflict & then pushed the file.
